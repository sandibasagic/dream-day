## Design Choices

### Fonts
When choosing fonts for the page, I stopped at [Google Fonts] https://fonts.google.com/. After a short search, I came across a font named 'Dongle'. I liked this font because of its shape and there is no extra sharp edges. The main purpose of the site is to make easy going experience with the user, so I choose this style of font. Same font style is also aplied in contact form, so the original font from contact form doesn't stand out too much. In case of fallback, I included CSS generic font family "sans-serif". 

### Icons
Here I used 4 icons for the "social-media" part. I choose background image as icon on a link, so user can clik on desired icon and visit homepage of choosen social media platform. I got icons via basic search on google https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en. After choosing icons, I then styled them in style.css file for better page position and look.

### Colours 
I have used https://rgbacolorpicker.com/ for picking colors. I have used variables for colors, because in case of changing mind about colors, I can only change variable tag and not every element that was styled with this color. There are three main colors. Because of very colorful background images, I have used RGBA function with opacity. Primary and overlay colors were mostly used in hamburger menu styling. Box color was used on page box elements. Below are color codes and pictures for better presentation.
